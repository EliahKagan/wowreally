# wowreally - See what `IsWow64Process` says

This is a tiny Rust program for Windows that calls [`IsWow64Process`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-iswow64process) on the current process.

Its purpose is to reveal and verify the behavior of that Windows API function, so it calls it even in situations where its return value could be inferred at compile time.

It uses the [`windows`](https://crates.io/crates/windows) crate to make the Windows API calls.

## Usage

No options are recognized. A line with the single word `true` or `false` is printed to standard output.

Example usage on an ARM64 system:

```text
PS C:\Users\pickens\repos\wowreally> cargo run --target=aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target\aarch64-pc-windows-msvc\debug\wowreally.exe`
false
PS C:\Users\pickens\repos\wowreally> cargo run --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
     Running `target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\debug\wowreally.exe`
false
PS C:\Users\pickens\repos\wowreally> cargo run --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target\i686-pc-windows-msvc\debug\wowreally.exe`
true
```

This is a trivial command-line utility. It is not currently usable as a library. For that, you may be looking for [`iswow64`](https://crates.io/crates/iswow64).
